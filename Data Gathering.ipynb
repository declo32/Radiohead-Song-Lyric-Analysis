Radiohead has a lot of songs, but I only wanted the ones from their nine studio albums (I'm more familiar with these so working with them should be easier). Using data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead_discography), I put them into a [`yaml` file](Radiohead-Discography.yaml), organized them by album and song title."
